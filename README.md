# Orbital-Mech-Proj
A program that plots periodic three body orbits with and without influence from the gravity of the sun.

This program investigates the effects of solar gravity on the stability of known periodic orbits in the Earth and Moon system. This will help gain a better understanding of how chaotic this system is. The known periodic orbit initial conditions are taken from NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) Solar System Dynamics (SSD) website. This website was also used to source location information for the sun relative to the Moon to calculate the effects of Solar gravity on the craft. A matlab live script was made to allow a user to pick almost any one of the orbits given on the SSD website and see how the solar gravity affects them. This is that program.

In order to run the program download all of the files. Open the file Main.mlx. This file contains all of the user inputs and displays the disired graphs. Each of the .xlsx files contains starting state variables for the periodic three body orbits. The .txt files contain ephemeris data for each the Earth, Moon, Earth-Moon barycenter, and Sun. Though the program only reads from the files for the Earth-Moon barycenter and the Sun. Given more time it would be possible to update the code so that the program is able to use ephemeris data for all three bodies.
